        <h1>Hello World</h1>
        <p>Hi there ðŸ‘‹
            My name is Khoa Nguyen, you can call me Kaynor. I'm currently a senior @Paul G. Allen School at UW, Research Assistant @Makeability Lab.

            ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on SoundWatch (~200 concurrent users per month). A very cool and helpful sound recognition app that provides push notifications for critical sounds around you, like Siren, baby crying, or dog barking. 
        </p><p>
            It's designed for the deaf and hard of hearing community.
        </p><p>
            What's more? It's the only Sound Recognition app that actually works on WearOS smartwatch, so you can listen to important sounds and get feedback at anywhere you go!
        </p><p>
            You might find it similar to the newly announced feature by Google. But we did it more accurately :)
        </p><p>
            ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Computer Graphics and Android Development.
        </p><p>
            ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Mobile Development, IOTs, and Machine Learning.

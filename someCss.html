<h1>Level 1</h1>
<h2>Two paragraphs that each have a different font (source: MAL)</h2>
<p class="p1">
  Senkuu has made it his goal to bring back two million years of human achievement and revive the entirety of those
  turned to statues. However, one man stands in his way: Tsukasa Shishiou, who believes that only the fittest of those
  petrified should be revived. As the snow melts and spring approaches, Senkuu and his allies in Ishigami Village finish
  the preparations for their attack on the Tsukasa Empire. With a reinvented cell phone model now at their disposal, the
  Kingdom of Science is ready to launch its newest scheme to recruit the sizable numbers of Tsukasa's army to their
  side. However, it is a race against time; for every day the Kingdom of Science spends perfecting their inventions, the
  empire rapidly grows in number. Reuniting with old friends and gaining new allies, Senkuu and the Kingdom of Science
  must stop Tsukasa's forces in order to fulfill their goal of restoring humanity and all its creations. With the two
  sides each in pursuit of their ideal world, the Stone Wars have now begun!

  Gabi Braun and Falco Grice have been training their entire lives to inherit one of the seven titans under Marley's
  control and aid their nation in eradicating the Eldians on Paradis. However, just as all seems well for the two
  cadets, their peace is suddenly shaken by the arrival of Eren Yeager and the remaining members of the Survey Corps.
  Having finally reached the Yeager family basement and learned about the dark history surrounding the titans, the
  Survey Corps has at long last found the answer they so desperately fought to uncover. With the truth now in their
  hands, the group set out for the world beyond the walls. In Shingeki no Kyojin: The Final Season, two utterly
  different worlds collide as each party pursues its own agenda in the long-awaited conclusion to Paradis' fight for
  freedom.
